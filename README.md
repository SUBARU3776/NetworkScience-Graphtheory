## This repository is designed for individuals new to network analysis.
The goal is to help learners understand the fundamental concepts of network theory and deepen their learning by executing scripts using Python.

### Content:
1. **Introduction**  
    - Overview of network analysis and basic workflow  
    - Basic operations with Python and NetworkX  

2. **Learning Terms by Creating Graphs**  
    - Fundamental concepts of graph theory  

3. **Finding the Core of the Network (Centrality Definition)**  
    - Learn about the definition of centrality and centrality metrics  

4. **Finding Paths (Graph Search Algorithms)**  
    - Learn how to find the shortest path  
    - Understand search methods  

5. **Division and Extraction (Understanding Network Structure and Identifying Attributes)**  
    - Learn how to identify specific communities or attributes  

6. **Network Models**  
    - Learn insights into understanding real-world networks  

7. **Structure Prediction (Link Prediction)**  
    - Predict future structures  

8. **Analysis Through Network Visualization**  
    - Learn the importance and cautions of visualization  

9. **Simulation**  
    - Simulate information diffusion  

### How to Run the Scripts:
Each chapterâ€™s directory contains Python scripts and sample data.  
To run the scripts, follow the steps below.

1. **Install Required Libraries:**  
   Install the necessary libraries (mainly NetworkX and Matplotlib) in your Python environment.  
   - Copy the code:  
     ```bash
     pip install networkx matplotlib
     ```

2. **Run the Script:**  
   Navigate to the directory of each chapter and execute the Python script.  
   - Copy the code:  
     ```bash
     python script_name.py
     ```

3. **Using the Dataset:**  
   Use the provided sample datasets to run the scripts and explore the structure and characteristics of the network.
